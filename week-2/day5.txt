#Write the IP address 135.1.1.25 mask 255.255. 248.0 in CIDR notation

convert the subnet mask into number of continue number of one's as we found the value of n by checking the n (which is continues 1)

255- 11111111

255- 11111111

248- 11111000

0- 00000000

as we find out there are 21 continue's 1 so the value of n become 21 

ip address in cidr become :- 

135.1.1.25/21
